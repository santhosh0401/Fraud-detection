This Python code is designed for fraud detection in a transaction dataset using a RandomForestClassifier and addresses class imbalance through oversampling. The input assumes a CSV file ('your_dataset.csv') containing transaction data with a 'fraud_label' column indicating fraud or not. The code first loads, explores, and preprocesses the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets. It then employs RandomOverSampler to handle class imbalance, creating a balanced training set. The RandomForestClassifier is used within a pipeline that includes standard scaling. The model is trained, predictions are made on the test set, and the classification report and confusion matrix are printed to evaluate the model's performance in detecting fraud.
